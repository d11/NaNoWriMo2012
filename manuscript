A Pension of Culverts.

It began with a downpour and an updraft. Then a message from my old friend Jenny. We'd always had a friendship that could be described as a bit "will they, won't they?", but with me being in favour of "will" and her coming down rather more strongly on the side of "won't". I'd pushed my luck at a Christmas party and hadn't heard from her since, so I was surprised to read that she wanted to meet for coffee on Sunday. 

[ TODO weather + setting ]

[ TODO Jenny is an artist ]

[ TODO enter coffee shop ]

I sat down with my flat white and heard a growl from under the table. Then something huge sunk its teeth into my leg. I screamed and did a sort of pneumatic pumping writhe which swept the condiments to the floor. Some deeper part of my brain took the reins and I plunged my fork down into the top of the black, furry head that was wrapped around my knee. The word 'jaguar' was hanging about in the front of my mind. I still seemed to be stabbing downwards and to the right, as if I was mashing potatoes. In the shadow I saw a flash of two eyes that looked like lemons. There was blood on my hand and wrist, I noticed. Some blood on the red leather seat. My leg was buzzing and I realised that it was no longer caught in anything, so I launched myself sideways out from the side of the table and glided satisfactorily across the tiles. I came to a rest just short of a well-groomed leg.

"What the fuck have you done to my cat, Gerald?"

That was Jenny's voice. I followed it upwards and discovered the owner looking down at me. Then I realised I was quite unintentionally staring up her skirt, and that just made her look even more disapproving so I averted my eyes. I've always been bashful in coffee shops. 

"What the fuck has your bloody jaguar done to my bloody leg, more like!" I sputtered, pained. I gestured with a shaking arm towards the dining booth that was the creature's lair. It was upright and staring balefully at my neck, but it didn't seem to be moving. 

"Actually she's a melanistic leopard. Yes, I am sorry about your leg, as a matter of fact... but I had to let her do that, or the whole thing would have been meaningless. I think you'll probably have to have it taken off, I'm afraid. You're bleeding quite a lot."

She was right. It was too wiry and angular to be a jaguar, now that I got a better look at it.

"The... whole thing would have been meaningless? What whole thing?" I asked.

"My current project." she explained, patting the hand-held video camera that I now saw she'd been pointing at me. She turned it off with every sign of satisfaction in a job well done. 

"It's a series of pieces about what happens when you let yourself do the things that everyone think's about doing but which society has conditioned you never to actually carry out."

"Like setting leopards on people you don't like, you mean? Because I-"

"Oh, Gerald, I don't not like you. It's just that it came into my head, and then I kept thinking about it. And once it was stuck in there, it would have been dishonest of me not to include it in the work."

Perhaps I was just insensitive to the more subtle requirements of fine art, but- no; that wasn't it. I quite like art. She was just a loony.

"Anyway, I should go." she said with a slightly apologetic air. "I've called you an ambulance."

She calmly decoupled the leopard's leash from the leg of the table and walked out of the cafe with the big black thing padding along behind her, looking for all the world as if it was in some quirky advert for a new perfume.

I was lucky about the leg, it turned out.
