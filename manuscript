A Pension of Culverts.

It began with a downpour and an updraft. Then a message from my old friend Jenny. We'd always had a friendship that could be described as a bit "will they, won't they?", but with me being in favour of "will" and her coming down rather more strongly on the side of "won't". I'd pushed my luck at a Christmas party and hadn't heard from her since, so I was surprised to read that she wanted to meet for coffee on Sunday.

[ TODO Jenny is an artist ]
Jenny had always liked the rain; she was the kind of woman that'd do something like that out of sheer perversity. That was probably what drew me to her. It was inevitable that she'd become an artist, once her parents had died - she could afford it. Irritatingly, she was quite successful with it. A small group of colourful 3d-printed "metasculptures" had made her one of the more talked-about figures of the London scene for a couple of months three years ago, and she knew how to make the right connections.

What the hell. I'd meet her. I knew it was a bad idea, but that didn't matter. Of course I was going to meet her. 

[ TODO enter coffee shop ]

I sat down with my flat white and heard a growl from under the table. Then something huge sunk its teeth into my leg. I screamed a bit and did a sort of pneumatic pumping writhe which swept the condiments to the floor. Some deeper part of my brain took the reins and I plunged my fork down into the top of the black, furry head that was wrapped around my knee. The word 'jaguar' was hanging about in the front of my mind. I still seemed to be stabbing downwards and to the right, as if I was mashing potatoes. In the shadow I saw a flash of two eyes that looked like lemons. There was blood on my hand and wrist, I noticed. Some blood on the red leather seat. My leg was buzzing and I realised that it was no longer caught in anything, so I launched myself sideways out from the side of the table and glided satisfactorily across the tiles. I came to a rest just short of a well-groomed leg.

"What the fuck have you done to my cat, Gerald?"

That was Jenny's voice. I followed it upwards and discovered the owner looking down at me. Then I realised I was quite unintentionally staring up her skirt, and that just made her look even more disapproving so I averted my eyes. I've always been bashful in coffee shops. 

"What the fuck has your bloody jaguar done to my bloody leg, more like!" I sputtered, pained. I gestured with a shaking arm towards the dining booth that was the creature's lair. It was upright and staring balefully at my neck, but it didn't seem to be moving. 

"Actually she's a melanistic leopard. Yes, I am sorry about your leg, as a matter of fact... but I had to let her do that, or the whole thing would have been meaningless. I think you'll probably have to have it taken off, I'm afraid. You're bleeding quite a lot."

She was right. It was too wiry and angular to be a jaguar, now that I got a better look at it.

"The... whole thing would have been meaningless? What whole thing?" I asked.

"My current project." she explained, patting the hand-held video camera that I now saw she'd been pointing at me. She turned it off with every sign of satisfaction in a job well done. 

"It's a series of pieces about what happens when you let yourself do the things that everyone thinks about doing but which society has conditioned you never to actually carry out."

"Like setting leopards on people you don't like, you mean? Because I-"

"Oh, Gerald, I don't not like you. It's just that it came into my head, and then I kept thinking about it. And once it was stuck in there, it would have been dishonest of me not to include it in the work."

Perhaps I was just insensitive to the more subtle requirements of fine art, but- no. That wasn't it; I quite like art. She was just a loony.

"Anyway, I should go." she said with a slightly apologetic air. "I've called you an ambulance."

She calmly decoupled the leopard's leash from the post under the table and walked out of the cafe with the big black thing padding along behind her, looking for all the world as if it was in a quirky advert for some new perfume.

I was lucky about the leg, it turned out. 

[ TODO in hospital ]



[ unknown ]
A towel draped over the back of a chair tiredly, and empty bottles littered the kitchenscape as if cast aside by the spirit of Comus  himself, during a particularly hasty revel.   Somebody had placed all of the forks into a kind of Sapphic configuration on the carpet of the lounge.  There was half a pot of greek yoghurt under the coffee table.  Twelve green penny whistles were arranged on the dresser, but I couldn't see any connection there.  

The windows had all been left wide open. I did spot the irony inherent in a housewarming party leaving the house colder than it had been before, but I was not in the best condition to appreciate it. I closed the windows.

I coughed vociferously at my shins; bent over like an old man. I was folded up like an envelope. "Put something on your feet", my father would have advised. Probably not a bad idea, but I left it out of stubborness. 
Somebody had left a foreign phone on the table, next to the bowl of peanuts. I wasn't sure who it belonged to, so I picked it up and collapsed onto the sofa to investigate.


It had a new message, from Jenny:

"Please dont hurt them i'm getting it for you i promise, i just need one more week x"
